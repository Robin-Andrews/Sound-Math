# Sonify a Square

## Topics covered
* Turtle graphics
* Basic use of Objects
* Loops
* Functions
* Pitch

There are many way that visual patterns can be translated into sound. To get you started, here's a simple program using Turtle graphics and Jython Music's Play.midi command.

## Exercises
* Have a play with sonify-square.py. Change some values and see what happens.
* Can you use your knowledge of loops and/or function to make this program quite a bit shorter?
* How many ways of matching visual data with audio data can you think of?
* This program uses just pitch, but to get you started, what about volume or direction? Maybe color?
* Explore other, more complex shapes - even in 3D!?


Have fun...
