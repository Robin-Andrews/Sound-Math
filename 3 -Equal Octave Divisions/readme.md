# Equal Octave Divisions

## Topics covered
* Keyboard events
* Geometric Progressions
* Typing

Normally in Western music, an octave is divided into 12 equal parts, represented by the geometric progression with a = 1 and r = 2^(1/12). It is geometric rather than arithmetic (revision needed?) because the human ear perceives pitch exponentially. 

Twelve even steps is not the only way to divide an octave. Alternative tunings are a big topic, but we can start fairly simply using Jyton Music and a little maths to do with powers and roots...

Don't worry too much about the details for now, but have a play with the accompanying programs.

Do you think the notes sound good together? Some more than others? Explore and discuss with your friends...

## Exercises
* Can you write a program to help improve your typing by using sound?
* What about a game where your friend works out what you just typed? (Keep it nice!)
* Or some kind of memory game using typed sounds?

Be creative folks!
