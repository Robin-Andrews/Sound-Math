# Hearing Recursion

## Topics covered
* Conditional branching
* Recursion
* Turtle graphics

This is a more advanced topic than others so far. There will be some build-up material added, but for now we'll jump straight in with a classic example of recursion - drawing a tree using Turtle graphics.

## Exercises
* Try slowing down the program and seeing if you can really understand what is happening
* Discuss with a friend and see if you agree
* Change the sounds
* See if you can sonify other aspects of the program such as the angle of the turtle
