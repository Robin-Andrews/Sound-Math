# Sound Math
## Exploring Programming and Math through Sound in Python

It seems to me that the connection between programming and maths is often underÂ­emphasised, even though the two subjects are deeply related.

Add to this the fact that many people are auditory learners, yet maths (beyond primary level) and Computer Science are taught almost exclusively through visual means and it starts to look there is a big gap in our educational provision. This is where this project comes in - making the links between sound, maths and computer programming, using a language that in the UK is now used by 98% of schools and is therefore easily accessible and widely supported.
