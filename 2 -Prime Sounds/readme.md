# The Sound of Prime Numbers

## Topics covered
* Prime numbers
* Functions
* Algorithms
* Algorithmic efficiency
* Modulus function
* Arrays

Have you ever wondered what the first 500 prime numbers sound like? (Of course you have). Well, wonder no longer, as with the help of Python, it’s easy to find out!

The is no known pattern to the primes, a fact which has tantalized mathematicians since ancient times, since there are nonetheless hints of pattern – a kind of ordered chaos is you will. For example, in the sound clip above, can you hear how the higher notes (representing prime numbers) frequently come in pairs? These are known as twin primes.

What else do you notice when you listen to the track?

The track was made using Jython Music which is a completely free, open source project that makes exploring sound with Python easy and fun.

## Exercises
* Play with the code and make some changes. E.g speed up the pattern, or choose different pitches
* Can you think of other ways to sonify the prime numbers?
* Research Twin Primes
